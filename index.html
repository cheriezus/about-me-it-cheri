   Hello.

   My name is Cheri and I am an LA Native, though recently moved to Illinois to avoid any distractions as I attend CodeFellows. I love to cook, write comedy (whether for myself or for other comedians), and be dragged around by friends to try new things such as camping and arts and crafts.  I started working at 17 and went full time once I graduated highschool, unfortunatley not attending college. My first job was at a comedy club, where I began as a telemarketer, and ended my employment as the Customer Service Manager and Marketing Assistant for both locations. Following four years of working at a comedy club, I worked as a Hardware Manager at a Drapery company, where I increased the amount of sales and decreased the waiting time for customers to receive their product by becoming the liasion to all of the departments, and improving our systems and inventory practices. My lastest job was at a non-profit where I served as an advocate for tenants from the for-profit side and acted as a case manager for clients by researching and collaborating with other organizations in order to better provide access to needed services. Some of my goals include: landing a job in software development, creating my own content, and making a shepherds pie becuase I would like to eat a shepherds pie right now.
